# Inshorts-Scraping-and-Analyzing

Led a group of three to scrape the news articles from the inshorts to perform topic modelling and sentiment analysis. 
Created a topic model to understand the scraped dataset and gain insights by converting large dataset into few words.
Conducted sentiment analysis to detect the overall sentiment behind the news articles.
